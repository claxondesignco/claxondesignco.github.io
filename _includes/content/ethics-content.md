### Charities  

I support non-profit organizations and charities and offer reduced rates for them, including a few pro-bono days a month for design and consulting. If you represent a non-profit or charitable organization, [contact me](#contact) for more information.  



### In Closing  

Ethics and character are more important than money. As such, it makes sense to be clear on where I stand. While these “rules” are helpful, they are not meant to be all-inclusive, and I reserve the right to turn down any project that I feel may not be a good fit.
