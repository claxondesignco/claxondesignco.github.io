      <p>I support non-profit organizations and charities and offer them reduced rates, including a few pro-bono days a month for design and consulting. If you represent a non-profit or charitable organization, <a href="#contact">contact me</a> for more information.</p>

      <h3 id="social-responsibility">Social Responsibility</h3>

      <p>Businesses have a responsibility to support and protect civil rights and the general public. As such, I don’t work with companies or organizations who engage in, promote, or profit from actions or speech that harms or discriminates against marginalized communities or the public at large.</p>

      <h3 id="vc-funding">VC Funding</h3>

      <p>I hesitate to work with funded startups. It’s nothing personal, I just think projects go better when it’s your own, hard-earned cash on the line.</p>

    <section class="columns__section">
      <h3 id="honesty">Honesty</h3>
      <p>I work to ensure truthfulness in communication and message, and I don’t work with companies whose messaging is dishonest or misleading.</p>
