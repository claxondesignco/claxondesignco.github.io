Brock is a well know artist in Indianapolis, having gallery showings since the early 2000’s. After garnering enough attention to have a showcase of his art at the Indianapolis International Airport, Brock’s outdated website—which depended on contacting the developer to update—had to go. The biggest focus of the project was on ease of updating. Together, we decided Squarespace would be the best solution for providing a simple interface—and a low monthly cost—to Brock. The final solution works well to completely focus on Brock’s art, and slightly compliment it with proper typography and subtle grays.
