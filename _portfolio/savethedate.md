Having met and lived in Indianapolis for so long, we wanted to make sure we paid homage to the beginning of our relationship, and our continued connection their through friends and family. We wanted something custom that would echo our connection to our two “hometowns”, as well as the season we both love, and the reason for the celebration.

Iconography seemed the best tool to accomplish this. I selected many symbols to represent each important piece—as well as a few select easter eggs—and organized them into their own quadrant.
