Theracare’s site was outdated, not only in design, but in content. An overly complex, difficult to use CMS stood between the team and basic updates. Rik from Manifest Brand and I worked together to bring Theracare’s site to the modern web.

We moved Theracare from the outdated, unusable CMS, to WordPress. To help the team update the site, we included customized templates and easy-to-use custom fields for each page, and simplified the WordPress backend to provide exactly what they need: an easy to use, modern site and design for attracting new clients and employees that last them for years to come.
