    <h2 class="section__headline">Simplicity.</h2>
    <p class="section__subhead">From design to implementation, great work is often simple work.</p>
  </header>

  <p>Simple doesnâ€™t mean limited or hobbled, it means that everything has purpose, and the final product is exactly what it needs to be. A complicated backend system is justified only if it simplifies a process or interface; a complex design system is justified in as much as it simplifies the addition of content and future enhancements. Simplicity scales.</p>

  <p>Claxon Design Co. is a new venture, however its anything but inexperienced. I have worked with clients ranging from local artists to large companies (including <a href="http://www.stackoverflow.com" target="_blank">Stack Overflow</a> and <a href="http://www.angieslist.com" target="_blank">Angie's List</a>) and hope to continue that level of diversity.</p>
