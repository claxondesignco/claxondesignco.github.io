    <p class="section__subhead">From design to implementation, great work is often simple work.</p>
  </header>

  <p>Simple doesnâ€™t mean limited or hobbled, simple means that everything has purpose, and the final product is exactly what it needs to be. A complicated backend system is justified only if it simplifies a process or interface; a complex design system is justified in as much as it simplifies the addition of content and future enhancements. Simplicity scales.</p>
